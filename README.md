# Rice Purchase Prediction

![Rice Banner](rice_banner.png)

## Overview 

Machine learning project aimed at predicting the need to purchase rice based on various factors such as days since last purchase, weather conditions, and sales data. This project uses logistic regression to create a predictive model that forecasts whether rice purchase is needed.

## Features üîçü§ñ

- **Data Generation**: Synthetic dataset creation with features influencing rice purchase decisions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization and descriptive statistics to understand data distributions and relationships.
- **Data Preparation**: Splitting and normalizing data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Logistic Regression used to build the predictive model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics including accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
- **Feature Importance**: Visualization of feature importances to understand which variables influence the prediction.

You can install the required libraries using pip:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
